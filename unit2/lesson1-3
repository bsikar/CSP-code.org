I use the internet to talk with people, do homework, and look up answers to problems I have.
My typical day consists of me using the internet for the purpose of learning and entertainment.
The internet has a very important role in my life as it is the primary source of information I use to learn.

Prompt1:
I see people sharing this kind of data (images, text, and sound) digitally through IRC's, discord, and online forums. Most people either want to share the data with friends or a random stranger. The purpose varies, but for me most of the time it is to have them help me learn.

Prompt2:
1)The internet is a a network of computers and servers that allow traffic flow of http and https requests to be resolved with the help of dns servers. The internet is a large spider web like structure with no center point.
2)I don't really have many questions on how the internet work since I already know a lot, but I guess ssl certificates and how do websites know so much information about your computer when you connect to them? For example, if you went to ipinfo.io it lists so many things; how do websites know all of this information.

 Do This 3 (since 1&2 are either already done in prompt 1/2 or are not a question):
The internet simulator lets you connect to a classmate and send messages. I do not know how it works, but I do know that you can send messages.

Prompt3:
The internet simulator is similar to the internet in the way that you can send and receive data, but it is very limited compared to what the internet is today. Even back before "graphical" (with a de/wm) operating systems were around you still had bulletin board systems. BBS' are more powerful than the internet simulator.
