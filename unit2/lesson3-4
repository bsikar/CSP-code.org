The Internet Protocol assigns an IP address to every network. The devices then connected to that network get another IP address. Every device on a network has the first IP address I talked about which is the network's public IP address and the second IP address I talked about which is the device's private IP address. Whenever a device on a network is trying to connect and communicate on the internet the device sends their public IP address to a DNS server and that domain name server then looks up the domain you typed in and find its associated public IP address. That public IP address is then sent back to your public IP address and then to you private IP address. This mailing type system allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the internet.
