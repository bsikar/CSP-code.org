Okay, being honest here.. I did not watch the video and I do not know what a "traversal" means. I am assuming a for-loop since that's what the video showed and it makes sense that you are traveling across the range in the for loop. With that said a for-loop would be a good method for accessing and updating items in a lengthy list because the only other way would be to manually write out the tens - hundreds - etc lines of code that the for loop would be doing instead. :)
