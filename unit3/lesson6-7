The difference between sequential programs and event driven-programs is that sequential programs will run the same every time, but with event-driven programs may or may not since the user is in control. With event-driven programs a user is able to interact with the program unlike sequential programs where they are not able to do so.

Programming is different from natural spoken language in many ways, one way is that in programming the program cannot infer that you are trying to do; if a program sees code it will only run that code and not make any of its own decisions. Programming is also different from natural spoken language because in programs they understand different syntax than speaking. You would never say for parenthesis int i is equal to 0 while i is less than three add one to i say hi, but instead you would say hi hi hi.
