I could also add:
ttyl
bc
tgif
rsvp
asap

We use abbreviations to communicate with one and another faster. Typing out a long string such as "as soon as possible" takes longer than "ASAP" or "asap". 

The advantages are that we can be more efficient and communicate less effortlessly.

Messages that repeat the same thing over and over again are easier such as "aaaaaaaaaaaa" vs a harder to compress "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". It is easier and more efficient since you are able to do "aaaa" and if "aaaa" repeates X times then it would result in a high compression.

Reflection:
I would tell the author that his email attachment was being compressed and that's why it shows as less bytes. I would tell them that its nothing to worry over. I would then show them some types of file compression. I would show them this unit so they can learn hands on rather than we explaining to them what is happening. I would do this because it would most likely make more sense to them.
