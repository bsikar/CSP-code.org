Prompt:
Our world is both better and worse because of digital representation. On the one hand, it allows artists to not worry so much about people stealing their work, but on the other hand, it creates so many headaches. Fair use on many things is such a gray area that results in people suing other people over things one might not have known wasn't fair use.

HIGHLIGHTING:
"a heart-eating gorilla on the chest of fighter Conor McGregor."
"A bankruptcy court judge decided that the tattoo, a lion on the right side of fighter Carlos Condit, had a value of $22,500, and the parties reached a confidential settlement."
"Mr. Gotti Flores said he had spent at least 40 hours tattooing NFL receiver Mike Evans, one of the few players with tattoos in Madden."

Summary:
USA TODAY wrote the article, "Athletes don't own their tattoos. That's a problem for video game developers," which explains that video game designers are being sued over player's tattoos on characters that are supposed to represent real people with tattoos. Video games are an entirely new area for copyright laws, making a gray area of what art somebody can digitize.

Prompt:
You told us we didn't have to do this since we are not working in groups.

Think:
Our world is both better and worse, but mostly worse because of digital representation. Digital representation has created many headaches for game designers, lawyers, sports players, tattoo artists, artists, and others. Everyone wants money, and Digital representation stands in the way of some and protects others.

Question 1:
"Mr. Gotti Flores said he had spent at least 40 hours tattooing NFL receiver Mike Evans, one of the few players with tattoos in Madden."

On December 31st, 2018, USA TODAY wrote the article, "Athletes don't own their tattoos. That's a problem for video game developers." This article explains lawsuits surrounding digitized tattoos on digitized sports players. Therefore sports players with their tattoos are being digitized. The report states, "Mr. Gotti Flores said he had spent at least 40 hours tattooing NFL receiver Mike Evans, one of the few players with tattoos in Madden."

Question 2:
"'My tattoos are a part of my persona and identity,' James wrote in a declaration of support for Take-Two and 2K Games. 'If I am not shown with my tattoos, it wouldn't really be a depiction of me.'"

On December 31st, 2018, USA TODAY wrote the article, "Athletes don't own their tattoos. That's a problem for video game developers." This article explains lawsuits surrounding digitized tattoos on digitized sports players. The purpose of video game designers digitizing sports players with their tattoos is to create a better representation of the player. LeBron James said, "My tattoos are a part of my persona and identity. If I am not shown with my tattoos, it wouldn't really be a depiction of me."

Question 3:
"In a lawsuit against the game developer and publisher THQ, which dissolved in 2013, a tattoo artist sought $4.16 million after his tattoo was used in the UFC Undisputed games."

The situation depicted in the article "Athletes don't own their tattoos. That's a problem for video game developers," written by USA TODAY, explains that lawyers are benefiting from lawsuits concerning digitized sports players with their tattoos. Lawyers are helping because, for each case, lawyers get paid for their work. The last suit, "against the game developer and publisher THQ, which dissolved in 2013, a tattoo artist sought $4.16 million after his tattoo was used in the UFC Undisputed games." With a potential $4.16 million payout, the lawyers would get paid royally.

Question 4:
"Although video game companies already pay to license copyrighted music, they may want to avoid the cost — as well as the logistical burden — of negotiating with hundreds of artists for rights to their tattoos." & "Mr. Shawn Rome and Mr. Justin Wright, two of the three tattoo artists who licensed their work to Solid Oak, said they had been deceived by its founder, Mr. Matthew Siegler, and never desired a lawsuit."

The situation depicted in the article "Athletes don't own their tattoos. That's a problem for video game developers," written by USA TODAY, explains that game developers and tattoo artists are harmed from lawsuits concerning digitized sports players with their tattoos. Game developers are harmed because "Although video game companies already pay to license copyrighted music, they may want to avoid the cost — as well as the logistical burden — of negotiating with hundreds of artists for rights to their tattoos." If the game developer does not negotiate with the hundreds of artists, then if a lawsuit unfolds, both the game developers and the tattoo artists would have to pay thousands in fees, harming both parties.

Question 5:
"Players' unions, many of which license the players' likenesses to video game publishers, and sports agents have advised athletes to secure licensing agreements before they get tattooed. Artists have an incentive to sign rather than pass up a client who could be a billboard for their work."

The impacts depicted by the situation in the article "Athletes don't own their tattoos. That's a problem for video game developers," written by USA TODAY, are unintended. The reasoning behind my answer stems from the fact that except for lawyers, no one likes lawsuits and the trouble of signing legal paperwork. Another reason that the impacts are unintended is that "Players' unions, many of which license the players' likenesses to video game publishers, and sports agents have advised athletes to secure licensing agreements before they get tattooed. Artists have an incentive to sign rather than pass up a client who could be a billboard for their work."

Poster Positions:
You told me that I do not need to complete the poster positions in class, but instead, answer the other questions on code.org. There may have been some confusion on this. You might have wanted me to answer the position poster questions here, but to not do the slide show. If what I am thinking is correct and I do not need to complete these three questions then that's great, but if I am wrong and you did want me to answer these questions, please let me know to get full credit. I would really hate to not get full credit for a miss understanding so please let me know and fix it for a full grade.

Prompt:
I do think that there is always both a benefit and a harm to digitizing analog content. With any content there is always a benefit and a harm, digitized analog content is no different. Just like yin and Yang or right and wrong one party will benefit and one will be harmed. There are very few instances where both parties will either benefit or both get harmed. From the article that I read, "Athletes don't own their tattoos. That's a problem for video game developers," there were 3 parties and 2 of the 3 were harmed resulting in only 1 party benefiting from digitizing analog content.
