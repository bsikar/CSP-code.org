Prompt - you can do anything in base 2. It would be more difficult, but you can do it.

If it is one bit per person then it would be 29bits. I don't know how many bits a person can have. If a person was the equivalent to an unsigned char then they could have up to 8 bits, etc for the other possible data types.
