There are hundreds of shades of blue. With this application we could probably only have 10 shades of blue.

We have already learned about using binary to make blocks of black and white. In this lesson we then introduced RGB. Our tool let us to assign x amount of bits per each R, G, and B. For example 9 = RRRGGGBBB. This allowed us to create many different colors.
