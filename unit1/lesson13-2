We should care about information being represented digitally because how information is represented is important. Before computers information was represented only on paper (not online) and people cared about the information that was written down. Even though there isn't any paper when you represent information digitally it should still have the same respect. Digitally represented information could help people in a number of ways. It could help them understand a topic, study for school, get paid for a job, and more. Without this digitally represented information studying in the 21 century could be immensely more difficult than how it is now. This impacts me and every student personally because without digitally represented information we couldn't learn how we are used to.

Where do I stand?
I think we are better because of digitally represented information. At first I was in the middle because I dislike law suits, but then I realized that digitally represented information is more than video game characters with tattoos. If digitally represented information means any information that has been or will be represented online(digitally) then that's the whole internet. Everything has copyright and for most people it doesn't effect us as much as people in law suits over copyright. I don't think any student in this day and age could survive if they didn't have the internet (after already having it). The information online is so vast and even though they all have copyright most of the information is free. You can find digitally represented information on any website and on any topic.
