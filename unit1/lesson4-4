They both are valid systems. They could be used for the same things, but not really. Like you cant use base 10 in places where you *need* to use base 2 and vise versa. You could try, but it wouldn't be effective. You would never use base 2 to buy a house. Saying that your house is worth $1111010000100100000 is ridiculous, but base 8 could work $7A120 sound weird, but is easier to say. Over all base 2 and base 10 mean the same thing, but one is (base 2) longer then the other (amount of characters to represent a given value).
