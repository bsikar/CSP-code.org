the amount of numbers you can make could either increase or decrease depending how you look at it. The decimal value would increase if you add a bit which then would allow for it to increase again when you add another bit. but lets say that you could have a max of 8 bits and you fill a bit. well even though your decimal value is increasing you could say that you only have 7 bits left. In math you would be increasing, but in memory allocation I'd think that you would be decreasing the max memory that you could have had.
