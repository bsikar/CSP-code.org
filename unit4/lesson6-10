1)
if (x > 300) { ... }
else if (x > 200) { ...}
...

This is an example of putting the most specific case first, if x is less than 300 then great, but if it isn't then the else if statement could be useful here is an example where the code would compile, but not work correctly:
if (x > 200) { ... }
else if (x > 300) { ...}
...

This wouldn't work because if x is not greater then 200 the else if statement would be never read, meaning it is never going to run.

2)
It is important to put the most specific case first to make sure that the code runs properly; if you fail to do that then the code wont work.
The helps prevent bugs more than errors since most of the time the code will still compile (depending on the language)
I am not sure, but higher level langs and rust might not compile because it knows that this is a bug.
