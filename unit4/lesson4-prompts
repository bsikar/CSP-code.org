These are the prompts from yesterdayâ€™s powerpoint, I do not know if you need them or not, but here you go:

Prompt 1: A baggy can represent a variable because on variable represents data associated with their data types: bool, char, int, float, etc... The baggy can only have 1 sticky note inside at one time, but that does not make a whole lot of sense because you still could put more than 1 sticky note inside. The sticky note inside is supposed to represent the data that the variable would be assigned to. If the variable was an array, vector, or just assigned on the heap rather than on the stack then the baggy should be changed to something else (maybe a different color baggy) 

Prompt 2: Anything can really be stored in a variable, but the answer you are most likely wanting is the data types. A variable in JavaScript is assigned a data type automatically: string, number, boolean, or undefined. Those data types listed are primitive data. It is important to have a meaningful name for all variables because having non-meaningful names can create confusion.
